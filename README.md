# Credit-Card-Fraud-Detection-Project

The given dataset contains the transactions between people, the information that they are fraud or not, and we are asked to differentiate between them. The ultimate intent is to tackle this situation by building classification models to classify and distinguish fraud transactions.

Steps Involved
1.Importing the required packages into our python environment.

2.Importing the data

3.Processing the data to our needs and Exploratory Data Analysis

4.Feature Selection and Data Split

5.Building six types of classification models

6.Evaluating the created classification models using the evaluation metrics

Importing the Packages
In this project, the primary packages are going to be:

Pandas to work with data, NumPy to work with arrays, scikit-learn for data split, building and evaluating the classification models, and finally the xgboost package for the xgboost classifier model algorithm.
